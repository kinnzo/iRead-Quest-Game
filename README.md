# iRead-Quest-Game
A game that predicts your player type and surrogates the game world based on the same.

You can play the game at "mud.it.dh-karlsruhe.de" in two ways: 
1. On your PC through any browser (preferably Microsoft Edge to get the sound effects) 
2. In your mobile browser, choose display complete web page rather than mobile formatted page. 

You can try unlocking both the ways to reach the final destination. 
The Output file contains the code which can run on Quest5. The ipnyb file is used to autogenerate the game code based on a database.
Most of the code is reused from the Quest template and the only the new objects are being automatically placed.
